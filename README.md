This repository contains scripts used to calculate hydrogen velocities published in Lodhia et al. (2024). We use the method of Lodhia & Clark (2022) to calculate maximum vertical velocity of subsurface hydrogen versus depth for normal geological conditions for a range of clastic and carbonate rocks. For more information on the methodology, please see Lodhia & Clark (2022).
